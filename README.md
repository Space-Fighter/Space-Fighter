- ðŸ‘‹ Yo, Iâ€™m @Space-Fighter. I am an artificial intelligence enthusiast. I have learnt a ton of stuff in this journey so far but still i have to learn alot more. By the way there are no limits of grasping and learning of the human brain or the 'Natural Neural Network'  so => always keep learning stuff in your passionðŸ˜€. 
Iâ€™m currently working on a self driving car project in Carla the autonomous vehicle simulator in order to devlop some agents with random reckless behaviour for the testing of autonomous cars using neural networks. One of the things that i love the most in this field is self driving cars. The one thing that i aim to make a startup on.ðŸ˜€
