- 👋 Yo, I’m @Space-Fighter. I am an artificial intelligence enthusiast. I love experimenting with neural networks and futuristic technologies. One of the islands in the ocean of artificial intelligence that i am truly fascinated by is the island of autonomous vehicles. 
Pursuing my fascination and passion I’m currently working on a self driving car project in Carla an autonomous vehicle simulator. If you have a startup / company on autonomous vehicles i would be really happy, excited, thrilled, exuberant, exhilerated etc etc to join your perception team as a **FREELANCER**.😀


Some of my work on self driving cars is using simply semantic segmentation and object detection to calculate steering angle. 
Here we see a car raging perfectly on the lanes of a carla town (emptied for testing purposes by the carla town mayor lol😁!). And you know what, it is just using semantic segmentation of the lanes it is presently in to calculate steering angle.

AT THE PRESENT in the project i am working on using a better semantic segmentation model and object detection to truly make a truly beautiful driver
