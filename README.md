- ðŸ‘‹ Yo, Iâ€™m @Space-Fighter. I am an artificial intelligence enthusiast. I have learnt a ton of stuff in this journey so far but still i have to learn alot more. By the way there are no limits of grasping and learning of the human brain or the 'Natural Neural Network'  so => I always keep learning stuff in my fieldðŸ˜€. 
Iâ€™m currently working on a self driving car project in Carla an autonomous vehicle simulator. One of the things that i love the most in this field is self driving cars. If you have a startup on autonomous vehicle or if i could make one if i had time, i would be really happy to join your perception team as a freelancer.ðŸ˜€


Some of my work on self driving cars is using simply semantic segmentation and object detection to calculate steering angle. 
Here we see a car raging perfectly on the lanes of a carla town (emptied for testing purposes by the mayor lol!). And you know what it is just using semantic segmentation of the lane it is presently in. Which is great on staying on not so highly curved lanes.

But at intersections it becomes moody and stuff. It would meet other cars and walls. Visit a cafeteria or a bookstand and what not -

So in order improve my agent i am working to use open space detection which will detect where the road is along with a neural network for lane segmentation for an overall better result. Besides i will also be adding object detection and waypoint which is just enough to make a superb tesla.
