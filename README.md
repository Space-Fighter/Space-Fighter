- ðŸ‘‹ Yo, Iâ€™m @Space-Fighter. I just turned up 14 lol. I am an artificial intelligence enthusiast. I started learning deep learning (a field in artificial intelligence) since I was 11 year old. I have learnt a ton of stuff in this journey so far. Continuing to learn stuff. By the way there are no limits of grasping and learning of the human brain so => always keep learning stuff in your passionðŸ˜€. 
Iâ€™m currently working on a rashless self driving car project in carla in order to devlop some agents with random rashlessness behaviour for the testing of autonomous cars. One of the things that i love the most in this field is self driving cars. The one thing that i aim to make a startup on.ðŸ˜€
- You can contact me via github for any interesting stuff.
